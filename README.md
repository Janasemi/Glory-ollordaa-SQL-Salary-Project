#Employee Salary Analysis

This project was built during my final module at the women techsters fellowship data science class.
Project goals was to use Structured Language Query(SQL) to clean a dataset on an organization's employee salary database.
This SQL project analyzes employee salaries for different companies. The data includes information such as Employee name, company location, job title, experience level, and salary.

##Database setup and loading

The project uses a MySQL database. The database has already been set up from a pre-existing salaries.csv file. It was then loaded and renamed. To view the file, you,ll need to run the following  SQL script that displays all the data in the salary file:

SELECT * 
FROM TechProject..salaries

##Queries

The project includes several SQL queries to analyze the employee salary data. You can find the queries in the 'Glory-ollordaa-SQL-Salary-Project.sql' file.

Contributions are welcome!!
